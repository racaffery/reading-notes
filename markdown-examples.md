Hi I am Rachel. I started my college life in web development, didn't quite grasp where I thought I needed to be towards the end of my schooling, so I moved to Cedar Rapids and switched to Graphic Design. Over the years jobs have put me back in the role of web development/design, so I figured captilize on it by acutally learning and developing this skill. 

I have 3 kids and have been married for 12 years. Looking forward to gaining insight, growth and seeing where this flies me.


# Growth Mindset

## What this means to me

Growth mindset means the ability to understand and adapt through challenges, obstacals and criticisms. **Growth mindset** is always learning.

***Three things to keep in mind while developing a growth mindset for me personally:***


**1. Overcoming Challenges and Obstacles**

If I am stuck on a problem and I get frustrated, I tend walk away/avoid. 

I need to take not from my kids learning in school with the phrase "I don't know how to do this... *Yet*"

**2. Effort**

It's really gratifying to put something off that you don't want to do, but it still looms overhead needing to be done. Take away from "Eat that Frog" book and just do the thing. 

It's done, it's out of the way, then you can move on to something else. 

**3. Success of others**

When you see someone "killing it out there", take notes, and adapt so that you can be inspired and get out there and "kill it" also.... but at your own pace. 

Comparison of other people is not your enemy but your spark to burn your own fire bright.
