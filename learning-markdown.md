## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a markup language that converts web-based text into plain text. Formatting the text on webpages is done mainly with non-alphabetic characters such as * or #. These characters tell the text how to appear on the screen. 

Markdown language is most used on the [*Github.com*](https://github.com/) coding platform. It is also used in technical writing, 

## GitHub

**GitHub** is a platform that web developers use to host, store and share code. 
  - This code is stored in files called repositories. 
      - These repositories hold the MarkDown code that formats text to show up on a web page. 
      
      
### Benefits of learning Markdown

- Formatted text that can then easily be converted to **HTML** or **XHTML**. Without the fuss of fully writing out <html> tags.
  
- Easier to learn than other web-based languages

- Can work seamlessly with other coding languages

### Some basic formatting examples 

This is a **bold** text.

This is *italic* text.

If I want to keep a ~~mitake~~ mistake, I can use strikethrough.
